# Polymerization-Reaction-Modeling

The styrene(A)/MMA(B)-copolymerization is to be carried out in a 15-L batch reactor under
bulk conditions at 65 degrees celsius. In order to be prepared for the planned experiments one decides to
make a few calculations first. In the literature, values for the reactivity ratios rA = 0:52 and rB = 0:46 are found.
